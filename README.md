# Grim Workshop

An experimental game engine that was written during the development of a small strategy game.

In it's current state, you can use your units to explore an "infinite" game world, as well as fight a _very_ basic boss, sacrifice dead creatures, gather wood from trees, and summon more units using the spellbook.

This was mostly a learning project so I could explore SDL2, OpenGL, and more advanced game programming constructs. Development began in December 2015.
