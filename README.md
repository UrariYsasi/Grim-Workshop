# Project Peon

An experimental strategy game where you lead a group of cultists on their journey to enlightenment after they have woken up at the base of a strange monument in the forest, with no recollection of what brought them there.

In it's current state, you can use your peons to explore an "infinite" game world, as well as fight a _very_ basic boss, sacrifice dead creatures, gather wood from trees, and summon more peons using the spellbook.

This was mostly a learning project so I could explore SDL2, OpenGL, and more advanced game programming constructs. Development began in December 2015.
